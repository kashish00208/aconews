aconews

Prerequisites


Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Installation
Clone this repository:

```bash
npm run dev
git clone https://github.com/kashish00208/aconews.git

Navigate to the project directory:
```


```bash
cd aconews
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```


```bash
npm install  # or yarn install
Use code with caution.

Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:
```


```bash
cd backend
npm run start  # or yarn start (if you used yarn)
```


This will typically start the backend server on a default port (e.g., port 3000). Check the backend code for the specific port number.

Start the Frontend Development Server:

```Bash
cd ../frontend  
npm run dev 
```

This will start the Vite development server, opening your browser to the default development URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173). You can then interact with the application in the browser.
